                ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm <span class="orange">Alessandro</span>, a <span class="orange">19-year-old</span> university student, based in the beautiful landscapes of Italy. <br><br>
                My fascination with <span class="orange">technology</span>, particularly computersðŸ’», ignited a desire to choose Computer Science as my college path. From <span class="orange">coding to problem-solving</span>, I find incredible exploring the intricate world of <span class="orange">algorithms and software development</span>. <br><br>
                But that's just the tip of the iceberg! Robotics has been a thrilling adventure for me. I've had the privilege of competing in <a href="https://rcjcroatia2023.eu" class="orange">RobocupJr</a>, clinching <span class="orange">3rd place in Italy</span> and proudly securing the <span class="orange">15th spot in Europe</span>. If you're curious, you can dive into the details in the project section. <br><br>
                ðŸŒŒ <span class="orange">Astronomy and space exploration</span> hold a special place in my heart. I'm a huge <span class="orange">space nerd</span>. I love learning about space and dream of working with cool space agencies like <span class="orange">SpaceX or ESA</span> as a software engineer. Maybe I'll even start my own space company one day ðŸš€! <br><br>
                Thank you for stopping by my corner of the internet! If you want to chat, hit me up on my socials linked above. Let's embark on this cosmic journey together. <span class="orange">Per aspera ad astra!</span> ðŸš€âœ¨
